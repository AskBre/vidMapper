VidMapper
================
----

This is a beta version of an open source video mapper built with openFrameworks.
The current status of the project is far from a viable alternative to other mappers out there. 
The code is heavily documentet to make it easy for newcomers to help out with development.

Usage
----
For time being, you need openFrameworks installed on your machine. Place this root folder in you myApps-folder within the openFrameworks-hierarchy. Compile and enjoy.
