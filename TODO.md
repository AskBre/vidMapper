Create a GUI

Add file dialog for loading videos
	Be able to import png sequences as well as video files

Need a way to be able to reset either the mask or the warper
	Maybe even go back one notch in warper editing too.

Change the color to reflect what mode I'm in

# For Warper
#################

Need a way to toggle whether it should maintain the aspect ratio or not

Colorize the square around the warps?
        Indivudual colors for each warper
        Have to go into ofxGLWarper's source code I believe

Be able to move the whole screen

Add a reset button
        For individual warps
        Maybe use VIM-style <num>+"r"?


# For Masker
#################

Double click when not in creation mode to add a vertex
        Add it between the two closest, connected vertices

Make the circles pop up organically and fancy (animation)

Save and load the shape!
        Can link it to the same as warper
        Press 's' and save everything
        Press 'l' and load everything
        No reason to save individually, is it?
