Create a GUI

Be able to import png sequences as well as video files

Enable resetting and deleting of surfaces

Change the color to reflect what mode I'm in

Add other visual cues

Refine the visuals

Enable option to move the whole surface by dragging the
middle of it

Colorize the square around the warps?
        Indivudual colors for each warper
        Have to go into ofxGLWarper's source code I believe

Double click mask not in creation mode to add a vertex
        Add it between the two closest, connected vertices

Make the circles pop up organically and fancy (animation)
